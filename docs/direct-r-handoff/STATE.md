# Live proof-development state — 2026-10-13

## Current request and exact targets

The authoritative new reference is
`PTS_rk_interprets_Tarski_Mostowski_Robinson_arithmetic_R_harmonized.tex`.

- Theorem 4, label `main`: the unary-domain relational interpretation.
- Theorem 7, label `thm:direct-R`: the arithmetic-expression functional interpretation.
- Both include all-index axiom realization, preservation of independently
  defined classical source deductions, ground proofs/refutations, and
  nonfaithfulness on arbitrary sentences.
- Neither complete theorem has been proved. The old `Kernel.Theorem5Target`
  is only the functional axiom-witness component, not either whole theorem.
- The latest user additionally requests the paper's PTS set model using
  rocq-archive/zfc, after the arithmetic work, with separate commits/pushes.
  This supersedes the older exclusion of set models. Its soundness has NOT
  been formalized. The paper states ZF+GCH, not unconditional ZFC.
- Ordinary commits/pushes are authorized. No gh, publish.sh, force-push, or merge.

## Checkout and environment

Arithmetic progress checkpoint on main: `a16646b`
(`Prove ground arithmetic and add harmonized unary foundations`), pushed.
It follows `b6fa20660860258717637426605353e0bf3e38e5`.
Inspect git log/status for subsequent model work; do not reset.
User's new harmonized TeX is preserved, including its
pre-existing trailing space at line 287. Downloaded `logs/` remain untouched
and untracked.

Installed local environment: `$HOME/.local/share/pts-rk-ci`; opam root
`opam/`, switch `pts-rk-ci`, binaries `bin/`, native ARM GMP `native/`.
OCaml 4.14.2, Rocq core/runtime 9.2.0, Stdlib 9.1.0, Equations 1.3.2+9.2,
Dune 3.23.1, opam 2.6.1, actionlint 1.7.12. GNU timeout is available.
The pristine upstream requires Rocq 9.2's Create Rewrite HintDb.

## Actually compiled

- Original pristine upstream, evaluator and checker soundness.
- DirectRStructural: structural substitution identities; generic dependent
  telescope formation/abstraction/projection; all-arity selector formation,
  typing, typed table application and beta-computation. Bridges connect to
  Codes.selector/Codes.selector_type and the named carrier nSelectorType.
  The named nSelector/operation-table/delta implementations still need bridges.
- DirectRFoundations: all fixed certificates; observed/admitted numerals;
  direct application lemmas for constructor closure, equality/congruence,
  arithmetic equations and order; functional admitted order reflexivity.
- DirectRProofs: uniform ground addition, multiplication and order,
  R1_realized and R2_realized. No legacy certify call remains in this module.
- DirectRGenerated, DirectRFirstOrder, DirectRObligations, DirectR facade,
  and the separate native-Prop arithmetic module. Compiling the definitions
  of generator contracts does NOT prove those contracts.
- DirectRUnary: the revised unary carrier and Church operations, Good,
  negative-test equality, unary-observation G and order, their exact ranks,
  constructor certificates, raw and admitted order reflexivity.
- DirectRCountermodel: the source structure N plus omega satisfies all
  relational and functional arithmetic axiom schemes, but not universal
  order reflexivity. This is NOT a PTS set model. Source non-derivability
  still needs a defined deduction system and its semantic soundness.

Assumption queries for R1_realized, R2_realized and ground_order_typed returned
`Closed under the global context`. The same holds for the checked structural
results and unary rank/closure/reflexivity certificates. No new axiom or
admission was introduced.

## Commands and evidence

Run from repository root:

```sh
export OPAMROOT="$HOME/.local/share/pts-rk-ci/opam"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/pts-rk-ci/bin:$PATH"
opam exec --switch=pts-rk-ci -- dune build --display=short --no-buffer \
  theories/DirectR.vo theories/DirectRUnary.vo \
  theories/DirectRCountermodel.vo theories/DirectRArithmetic.vo
```

Latest module-build transcript: `_build/local-ci-logs/harmonized-modules.log`.
Other exact transcripts: `ground-families-build.log`, `ground-assumptions.log`,
`structural-assumptions.log`, `unary-assumptions.log` in that directory.

`DIRECT_R_STAGE_SECONDS=120 bash tools/check-local-ci.sh` passed stages
01 through 12, including the new dependencies, then found an uninferred scope
in DirectRTests' zero-budget example. Scope is now explicitly 0.
The subsequent command
`opam exec --switch=pts-rk-ci -- timeout 120 dune build --display=short
--no-buffer theories/DirectRTests.vo`
returned 124. Transcript: `_build/local-ci-logs/examples-build.log`.
No full green test/CI run is claimed; the ordinary CI stage limit remains 1200.
An attempted timing probe during dependency rebuilding failed to import the
temporarily absent Foundations object; this is not a new source proof error.
A subsequent probe after rebuilding reached and completed R3_1_0 (about
8 seconds for construction/checking, 2 seconds for Qed), then reached R4_0
without completing it within its 20-second diagnostic limit. The full
120-second examples timeout is still a failure to verify the whole suite.

Tracked build/type/assumption evidence is retained in
verification/harmonized-2026-10-13.log. All 22 final assumption queries there
returned Closed under the global context, with no import or query errors.

Workflow lint and shell syntax were checked. Whitespace checking of agent
changes passes; the supplied TeX's existing trailing space is unchanged.

## Exact remaining work and next commands

First rerun the changed modules using the command above, then inspect the slow
example with (from `_build/default`, after dependencies finish):

```sh
opam exec --switch=pts-rk-ci -- timeout 120 rocq compile -time \
  -R theories PTSrk theories/DirectRTests.v
```

Uniform mathematical goals:
1. Prove named-selector/operation-table/delta bridges and finite observation
   realization. For unary Theorem 4, only d0, ds, and Up(P) are needed.
2. Construct the uniform positive invariant and bounded-case proof for every
   external cutoff and arbitrary admitted object, preserving G separately.
3. Prove no_back, then R3–R5 and ground refutations; add ground-expression
   evaluation witnesses, not just numeral calculations.
4. Define an independent classical FOL deduction system and prove substitution,
   guarded equality replacement, stability and deduction preservation. Connect
   source countermodel soundness to non-derivability of universal reflexivity.
5. Only claim either main theorem after unconditional final types, a fresh
   successful build and transitive Print Assumptions.

Earlier failed approaches: blanket cbv in the symbolic tactic unfolds symbolic
numerals and loses reusable typing evidence. Direct tApp/arrow applications
plus Structural.structural_substitution_in avoid that. Eauto with transitivity
as a global search rule became expensive for multiplication; the successful
proof supplies the two transitivity steps explicitly.

## Subsequent set-model foundations checkpoint

The requested ZFC dependency was inspected at
`ede7126560844c381c2b021003a8dbcb0668ecad`. Its full Makefile failed on the
removed elimtype tactic. A pinned, licensed subset (Sets/Axioms/Cartesian)
is now vendored; one tactic in Cartesian was translated without changing
its statement or assumptions. No gh or publish.sh was used.

`models/SetFunctions.v` constructs the ordinary dependent function set as a
subset of a powerset. Graph abstraction, beta computation, relational
application, uniqueness and empty-fiber emptiness compile, with all five
Print Assumptions reports closed under the global context.

Exact successful command:
`opam exec --switch=pts-rk-ci -- dune build --display=short --no-buffer models/SetFunctions.vo`.
Log: `_build/local-ci-logs/set-functions-build.log`; tracked report under
`verification/set-functions-2026-10-13.log`. CI has a separate model-foundations
dependency stage and still checks every original stage.

This is NOT yet the PTS model or its soundness theorem. Next mathematical
work is the actual countable cardinal/sort-code universes and extensional
decoding, followed by finite-aleph/GCH bounds, coherent coding bijections,
substitution/beta semantics and soundness of the original typing judgment.
See models/README.md. Do not replace those obligations by a record assuming
model laws, or infer Bottom nontriviality merely from the empty-fiber lemma.
